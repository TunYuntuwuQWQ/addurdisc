This mod can help you add your own discs.
Put the ogg audio file in /.minecraft/.addurdisc/assets/addurdisc/sounds/ 
and the file name does not contain characters other than lowercase letters、numbers、-._ 
and this mod will help you add it to the game as a disc!

You can use the config file to change the directory of the resource file and whether the record can be dropped by creepers.
You can also overwrite the png file of /.minecraft/.addurdisc/assets/addurdisc/texture/item/xxx.png to customize your disc textures.
Note: The sounds resource files on the server side must be consistent！！
