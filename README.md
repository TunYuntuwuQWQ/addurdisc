This mod can help you add your own discs.
Put the ogg audio file in .minecraft/.addurdisc/assets/sounds/ 
and the file name does not contain characters other than lowercase letters、numbers、-._ 
and this mod will help you add it to the game as a disc!

You can use the config file to change the directory of the resource file and whether the record can be dropped by creepers.
